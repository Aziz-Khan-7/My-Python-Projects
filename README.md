# My Python Projects

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Aziz, Iâ€™m 14 years old and currently learning Python and Web Development.  
This repository contains my **first Python projects** â€” simple but fun exercises to practice programming basics.  

## Projects Included
- **Calculator 1** â€“ a basic arithmetic calculator.  
- **Calculator 2 ("Random Python Project")** â€“ greets the user, asks for details, then runs a calculator.  
- **Weight Converter** â€“ converts between kilograms and pounds.  
- **Temperature Converter** â€“ converts Celsius â†” Fahrenheit.  
- **Madlibs Game** â€“ a fun word game that creates a story.  
- **Shopping Cart Program** â€“ calculates the total cost of items.  
- **Logical Operators Example** â€“ practicing `and`, `or`, and `not` conditions.  

## Purpose
These projects are my first steps in learning Python. They helped me practice:
- Variables and data types  
- User input and output  
- If/else conditions  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Basic program structure  

## Next Steps
Iâ€™d love feedback and suggestions for:
- Making my code more **Pythonic**  
- Ideas for **new beginner-friendly projects** to build next
