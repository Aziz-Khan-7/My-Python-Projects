# My Python Projects

Hi! 👋 My name is Aziz, I’m 14 years old, and I’m a high school student learning Python and Web Development.  
This repository contains my **first Python projects** — simple but fun exercises to practice programming basics.  

---

## 🚀 Projects Included

1. **Calculator 1** – a basic arithmetic calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide).  
2. **Calculator 2 ("Random Python Project")** – greets the user, collects information, and performs arithmetic based on user status.  
3. **Weight Converter** – converts between kilograms and pounds.  
4. **Temperature Converter** – converts Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit.  
5. **Madlibs Game** – a fun word game that builds a story from user inputs.  
6. **Shopping Cart Program** – calculates total cost of items based on price and quantity.  
7. **Logical Operators Example** – demonstrates `and`, `or`, and `not` conditions in Python.

## 🎯 Purpose

These projects helped me practice:

- Variables and data types  
- User input and output  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Arithmetic operations  
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)  
- Writing structured Python programs

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Learned

- **Python 3** – basic syntax, operators, and input/output  
- Problem-solving with step-by-step logic  
- Structuring code with clear comments  
- Debugging beginner errors  
- Making code readable and user-friendly  

---

## 🌱 Future Goals

I’m looking to expand my Python skills by building:

- Mini games (tic-tac-toe, number guessing game)  
- More advanced calculators (like BMI calculator, loan calculator)  
- File handling programs (saving user data, reading/writing files)  
- Simple automation scripts (e.g., text-based to-do list)  
- Learning functions and modules to make my code more organized

## 💡 Feedback & Suggestions

I’d love to know:

- How to make my code more **Pythonic**  
- Any ideas for **new beginner projects** I should try next  
- Tips for organizing and improving beginner repositories

Thanks for checking out my code! 🚀  
I hope my projects inspire other beginners to start coding too! 🐍
